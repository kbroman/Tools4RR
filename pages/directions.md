Lectures are Fridays at 11am in 1116 Biochem, 420 Henry Mall. 

This is the older-looking (on the outside) Biochemistry Building on
Henry Mall, across from the Biotech Center. See the photo below and
[this map](http://map.wisc.edu/s/psk50tw2).

Enter on Henry Mall and take an immediate left; the room will be on
your left.
